## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Affine Cipher**  
   A monoalphabetic substitution cipher based on mathematical operations involving modular arithmetic.

2. **Vigen√®re Cipher**  
   A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext by varying amounts.

3. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**  
   Used for calculating the modular inverse of a number, which is a key operation in many cryptographic algorithms.

4. **RSA Encryption & Decryption**  
   A widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses public and private keys for secure communication.

5. **El-Gamal Encryption & Decryption**  
   An asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, using modular exponentiation.
